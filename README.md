This should fix dark mode for elementary's System Settings.
Open your terminal and type in the following and a setup should appear.
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KorbsStudio/elementary-settings-dark-mode-fix/master/sh-files/run.sh)
```
Don't worry, the file that opens your system settings will be back up to `/usr/share/korbs-studio/` if something breaks.

### To Do List
- [x] Fix dark mode for wingpanel
- [ ] ~~Fix dark mode for File Manager when it runs as admin~~ Impossible -_- 
- [ ] ~~Fix dark mode for ScreenRec~~
